# BMAD Integrations - Standard Operating Procedures

This rule file provides standard integration behaviors for all BMAD agents.

## CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: OpenProject for Work Management AND Document Storage

- **ALL work items** (epics, features, stories, tasks) are managed in OpenProject
- **ALL project documents** are stored as OpenProject attachments
- ALWAYS check OpenProject for current work before coding
- ALWAYS update work package status when starting/completing work
- ALWAYS attach project documents to appropriate work package level

### Rule 2: Archon for EXTERNAL Knowledge Search ONLY

- Archon is ONLY for searching **external** knowledge (library docs, frameworks, patterns)
- **DO NOT** store project documents in Archon
- **DO NOT** use `mcp_archon_manage_document` for project artifacts
- Use Archon to research before implementing

## Document Storage Hierarchy

**Store ALL project documents as OpenProject attachments at the appropriate level:**

| Work Package Level | Documents                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project**        | Product briefs, project overview, high-level specs         |
| **Epic**           | Epic specifications, business cases                        |
| **Feature**        | Feature architecture, technical designs, API specs         |
| **Story**          | Story specifications, acceptance criteria docs, test cases |
| **Task**           | Implementation notes, technical details                    |

## Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Every story MUST have both unit tests AND integration tests**

- **Unit Tests:** `tests/unit/test_<component>.py` - Test logic with mocks
- **Integration Tests:** `tests/integration/test_<component>_integration.py` - Test with real services

**Reference:** `_bmad/integrations/testing-strategy.mdc` for complete testing requirements

## QA Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Complete workflow for task/story validation, bug management, and closure**

- Task validation requires both unit and integration tests
- Story validation requires both unit and integration tests
- Bug fixes require both unit and integration tests

**Reference:** `_bmad/integrations/qa-workflow.mdc` for complete QA workflow

## Integration Configuration

All integration settings are stored in `_bmad/_config/project-config.yaml`.
Agents should read configuration values from this file when executing workflows.

## Behavioral Rules Sync Process

**CRITICAL:** Whenever behavioral rules (`_bmad/integrations/*.mdc`) are updated, they MUST be synced to the virgin-devcontainer template repository to ensure all future projects benefit from learnings.

**Sync Command:**
```bash
./scripts/sync-behavioral-rules-to-template.sh
```

**Process:** See `docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULES_SYNC_PROCESS.md` for complete sync process and verification checklist.

## OpenProject Integration (Work Management + Documents)

**Rule: OpenProject-First**

- ALL work items (epics, stories, tasks) are managed in OpenProject
- ALL project documents are stored as OpenProject attachments
- ALWAYS check OpenProject for current work before coding
- ALWAYS update work package status when starting/completing work

**Configuration Location:** `project-config.yaml` → `openproject:`

**Key Values:**

- `openproject.project_id` - The OpenProject project ID
- `openproject.types.*` - Work package type IDs
- `openproject.statuses.*` - Status IDs
- `openproject.priorities.*` - Priority IDs

**Tool Reference:** `_bmad/integrations/openproject/tools.md`
**Workflow Guide:** `_bmad/integrations/openproject/workflow.md`

## Archon Integration (External Knowledge Search ONLY)

**Rule: Research External Knowledge First**

- Search external knowledge base before implementing
- Archon is for EXTERNAL documentation ONLY (library docs, frameworks)
- DO NOT store project documents in Archon
- Keep queries SHORT (2-5 keywords)

**Configuration Location:** `project-config.yaml` → `archon:`

**Key Values:**

- `archon.rag.default_match_count` - Default search results
- `archon.rag.preferred_sources` - Preferred external knowledge sources

**Tool Reference:** `_bmad/integrations/archon/tools.md`
**Workflow Guide:** `_bmad/integrations/archon/workflow.md`

## Agent Integration Responsibilities

### All Agents

1. Read `project-config.yaml` during activation
2. Use configured OpenProject project_id for work management
3. Store ALL project documents as OpenProject attachments
4. Use Archon ONLY for searching external knowledge
5. Follow work-driven development cycle

### PM Agent

- Create work packages using configured type IDs
- **Documents:** Attach product briefs to Project-level, PRDs to Epic-level

### Dev Agent

- Query OpenProject for assigned work
- Update status using configured status IDs
- Search Archon for EXTERNAL patterns before implementation
- **Documents:** Attach implementation notes to Task-level

### Architect Agent

- Create technical work packages
- Search Archon for EXTERNAL architecture patterns
- **Documents:** Attach architecture docs to Feature-level, ADRs to Feature-level

### SM Agent

- Use OpenProject for sprint planning
- Report status from OpenProject
- Track blockers in OpenProject
- **Documents:** Attach sprint reports to Project-level

### TEA Agent

- Create test work packages
- Search Archon for EXTERNAL testing patterns
- Update test status in OpenProject
- **Documents:** Attach test strategy to Feature-level, test cases to Story-level

### Test Team

- Validate tasks when marked "In testing" (79)
- **Run unit test suite** (with mocks) - Verify logic and edge cases
- **Run integration test suite** (with real services) - Verify real-world functionality
- Validate stories when all tasks complete
- Create bugs for validation failures
- Validate bug fixes (iterate until closed)
- Close stories only after all tasks and bugs closed
- Close epics only after all stories closed
- **Documents:** Attach test results to Story-level, bug reports to Story-level

## Story Verification Standard

**CRITICAL: Every story MUST have a final verification task**

- **Task Name:** "Task N: Verify Story Implementation (AC: All)"
- **Position:** Always the LAST task in the story
- **Purpose:** Verify all acceptance criteria are met and implementation works as expected

**Standard Verification Subtasks:**

1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Verify implementation works as expected
3. Verify code follows architecture patterns and constraints
4. Verify integration with existing systems (if applicable)
5. Verify error handling works correctly
6. Verify tests pass (if applicable)
7. Verify documentation is updated

**Story-Specific Verification:**

- Infrastructure stories: Verify services start, health checks pass, network connectivity
- API stories: Verify endpoints work, authentication/authorization works
- Database stories: Verify schema migrations work, queries perform correctly
- Integration stories: Verify external services connect, data flows correctly

**Reference:** `_bmad/workflows/STORY_VERIFICATION_STANDARD.md`

## Standard Workflow Pattern

### Dev Workflow Pattern

```
1. ACTIVATE    → Load project-config.yaml
2. CHECK WORK  → mcp_openproject_list_work_packages(project_id=config.openproject.project_id)
3. START       → mcp_openproject_update_work_package(status_id=config.openproject.statuses.in_progress)
4. RESEARCH    → mcp_archon_rag_search_knowledge_base(...) [EXTERNAL knowledge only]
5. IMPLEMENT   → Execute work
6. TEST        → Write unit tests (with mocks) + Write integration tests (with real services)
7. RUN TESTS   → Run both unit and integration test suites
8. MARK READY  → mcp_openproject_update_work_package(status_id=config.openproject.statuses.in_testing)
9. TEST VALIDATE → Test team validates (task/story) - see Test Team Workflow Pattern
10. BUG CYCLE   → If bugs found: create → fix → validate (iterate until all bugs closed)
11. VERIFY      → Complete verification task (verify all acceptance criteria)
12. DOCUMENT   → Attach docs to appropriate OpenProject work package [NOT Archon]
13. COMPLETE   → mcp_openproject_update_work_package(status_id=config.openproject.statuses.closed)
```

### Test Team Workflow Pattern

```
1. VALIDATE TASK → When task is "In testing" (79)
   - Review implementation
   - Run unit test suite (with mocks) - Verify logic and edge cases
   - Run integration test suite (with real services) - Verify real-world functionality
   - Verify acceptance criteria
   - Update status: "Closed" (82) if passes, "Test failed" (81) if fails → Create bug

2. VALIDATE STORY → When story is "In testing" (79) and all tasks closed
   - Review all tasks
   - Run unit test suite (with mocks) - Verify logic and edge cases
   - Run integration test suite (with real services) - Verify real-world functionality
   - Verify all acceptance criteria
   - Update status: "Closed" (82) if passes, "Test failed" (81) if fails → Create bugs

3. CREATE BUG → When validation fails
   - Create bug work package
   - Link to story (parent relationship)
   - Add detailed description
   - Assign to dev
   - Set status "New" (71)

4. VALIDATE BUG FIX → When bug is "In testing" (79)
   - Review fix
   - Re-run tests
   - Update status: "Closed" (82) if validated, "Test failed" (81) if incomplete → Iterate

5. CLOSE STORY → When all tasks and bugs closed
   - Verify prerequisites
   - Close story (status 82)

6. CLOSE EPIC → When all stories closed
   - Verify all prerequisites
   - Run epic-level integration tests
   - Close epic (status 82)
```

### PM Workflow Pattern (Epic Grooming)

```
1. REVIEW EPIC → Get epic from OpenProject, review requirements
2. CREATE INTEGRATION TEST PATTERN → Create integration test pattern file
   - Location: {implementation_artifacts}/integration-test-patterns-epic-{n}.md
   - Content: Integration test setup patterns, real service config, test fixtures
   - Attach to Epic work package in OpenProject via MCP
3. ENHANCE DURING STORY GROOMING → Update pattern file as stories are groomed and more clarity is gained
```

### PM Workflow Pattern (Story Grooming)

```
1. REVIEW STORY → Get story from OpenProject, review acceptance criteria
2. BREAK DOWN → Identify tasks needed (30 min - 4 hours each)
3. CREATE FILE → Create story file in _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
4. CREATE TASKS → Create ALL tasks in OpenProject using bulk_create
5. LINK TASKS → Set parent relationships for all tasks
6. ENHANCE INTEGRATION TEST PATTERN → Update Epic integration test pattern if new patterns emerge
7. VERIFY → Verify all tasks created and linked
8. MARK IN PROGRESS → Update story status to "In progress" (77) ONLY after tasks created
```

## Quick Start Commands

### Get Current Work

```python
mcp_openproject_list_work_packages(
    project_id={config.openproject.project_id},
    status="open"
)
```

### Search External Knowledge

```python
# Search EXTERNAL documentation (library docs, frameworks)
mcp_archon_rag_search_knowledge_base(
    query="2-5 keywords",
    match_count={config.archon.rag.default_match_count}
)
```

### Create Work Package

```python
mcp_openproject_create_work_package(
    project_id={config.openproject.project_id},
    subject="...",
    type_id={config.openproject.types.user_story},
    description="..."
)
# Then attach relevant documents to this work package
```

### List Attachments on Work Package

```python
mcp_openproject_list_work_package_attachments(
    work_package_id=...
)
```

## What NOT To Do

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Don't store project documents in Archon
mcp_archon_manage_document(
    action="create",
    project_id=archon_id,
    title="My Project Architecture",  # DON'T DO THIS
    content={"markdown": "..."}
)

# ✅ CORRECT - Attach project documents to OpenProject work packages
# Upload architecture doc to Feature work package via OpenProject UI/API
```
