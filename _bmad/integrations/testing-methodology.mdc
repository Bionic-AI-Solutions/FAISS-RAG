# Testing Methodology - Core Testing Procedures

**Status:** MANDATORY REQUIREMENT  
**Applies To:** All agents (Dev, Test Team, TEA, PM)

This Cursor rule file aggregates all core testing methodology procedures from BMM test architecture. These procedures define the fundamental testing requirements and responsibilities for all BMAD projects.

## Procedures Location

All testing methodology procedures are located in: `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/`

**This is the correct architectural location** - testing procedures are core development methodology (BMM), not external system integrations.

## Core Testing Procedures

### 1. Testing Strategy
**Location:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/testing-strategy.md`

**CRITICAL RULE:** Every story MUST have both unit tests AND integration tests.

**Key Requirements:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_<component>.py` - Test logic with mocks
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_<component>_integration.py` - Test with real services
- Both test suites must pass before marking task "In testing" (79)

**Reference:** See full procedure for complete requirements, patterns, and agent responsibilities.

### 2. QA Workflow
**Location:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/qa-workflow.md`

**Complete workflow for task/story validation, bug management, and closure.**

**Key Requirements:**
- Task validation requires both unit and integration tests
- Story validation requires both unit and integration tests
- Bug fixes require both unit and integration tests
- Story closure requires all tasks closed, all bugs closed, and validation passed

**Reference:** See full procedure for complete workflow, status flows, and role responsibilities.

### 3. System Readiness
**Location:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/system-readiness.md`

**Responsibility for ensuring dependency systems are running before integration tests.**

**Key Requirements:**
- **PRIMARY:** Test Team / TEA Agent responsible for system readiness before validation
- **SECONDARY:** Dev Agent responsible when running integration tests during development
- Never run integration tests with services down and claim tests pass
- Use project scripts for service management

**Reference:** See full procedure for complete checklist, service startup procedures, and failure scenarios.

### 4. Test Data Responsibility
**Location:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/test-data-responsibility.md`

**Responsibility for creating test data and fixtures.**

**Key Requirements:**
- **Mock Fixtures (Unit Tests):** Dev Agent creates during TDD
- **Real Test Data (Integration Tests):** Dev Agent creates, Test Team validates
- **Shared Fixtures:** TEA Agent / Test Team creates during framework setup
- **Integration Test Patterns:** Test Team / TEA creates during Epic grooming
- **Data Factories:** TEA (framework), Dev (story-specific)

**Reference:** See full procedure for complete responsibility matrix and workflow integration.

### 5. Browser Testing
**Location:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/browser-testing.md`

**Mandatory browser-based integration testing procedure for UI development.**

**Key Requirements:**
- All frontend UI development must include browser testing
- Pre-testing checklist: Backend services, frontend server, test data
- Complete user journey testing required
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing
- Documentation required for each testing session

**Reference:** See full procedure for complete testing checklist, tools, and escalation process.

## Quick Reference

### For Dev Agent
1. Write unit tests (with mocks) + integration tests (with real services)
2. Create mock fixtures for unit tests
3. Create real test data fixtures for integration tests
4. Verify services running before integration tests
5. Run both test suites before marking task "In testing" (79)

### For Test Team / TEA Agent
1. Verify services running before validation (PRIMARY responsibility)
2. Run unit test suite (with mocks) + integration test suite (with real services)
3. Create shared fixtures during framework setup
4. Create integration test patterns during Epic grooming
5. Validate test data quality during validation

### For QA / UX Teams
1. Conduct browser testing for all UI development
2. Verify backend services running before browser testing
3. Test complete user journeys
4. Document test results and issues
5. Sign off on demo readiness

## Integration with Other Procedures

### Testing Strategy Integration
- **Reference:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/testing-strategy.md`
- Defines unit + integration test requirements
- All other procedures reference this as the foundation

### QA Workflow Integration
- **Reference:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/qa-workflow.md`
- Defines complete validation workflow
- Integrates with testing strategy and system readiness

### System Readiness Integration
- **Reference:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/system-readiness.md`
- Defines responsibility for service management
- Required before running integration tests

### Test Data Integration
- **Reference:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/test-data-responsibility.md`
- Defines responsibility for test data creation
- Required for both unit and integration tests

### Browser Testing Integration
- **Reference:** `_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/browser-testing.md`
- Defines UI testing requirements
- Integrates with system readiness (backend services)

## Architecture Note

**Why procedures are in BMM, not integrations:**

- **BMM** (`_bmad/bmm/`) = Development methodology, project-specific processes
- **Integrations** (`_bmad/integrations/`) = External system integrations (OpenProject, Archon)

Testing procedures are **core development methodology**, not external system integrations. They belong in BMM test architecture (`_bmad/bmm/testarch/procedures/`).

This Cursor rule file (`testing-methodology.mdc`) serves as an aggregator that references the procedures in their correct location, ensuring they are loaded automatically via `alwaysApply: true`.
