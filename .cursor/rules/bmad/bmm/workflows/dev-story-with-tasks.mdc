# BMAD BMM Workflow: dev-story-with-tasks

**Workflow Type:** Story Development  
**Agent:** Dev  
**Phase:** Implementation

## Purpose

Implement a story by working through tasks, updating task statuses, and ensuring all tasks are complete before marking story ready for test validation.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Verify Tasks Exist

**CRITICAL:** Before starting implementation, verify all tasks are created in OpenProject.

```python
# Verify tasks exist
children = mcp_openproject_get_work_package_children(parent_id=story_id)
tasks = [c for c in children["children"] if c["type"] == "Task"]

if not tasks:
    raise Exception("No tasks found. PM must create tasks during grooming phase.")
```

### Step 2: Implement Tasks Sequentially

**For each task:**

1. **Start Task** → Update status to "In progress" (77)
2. **Implement** → Write code, run tests
3. **Complete Task** → Update status to "In testing" (79)
4. **Add Comment** → Document implementation and test results
5. **Update Story File** → Mark task as complete

```python
# Start task
mcp_openproject_update_work_package(
    work_package_id=task_id,
    status_id=77  # In progress
)

# ... implement task ...

# Mark task ready for test
mcp_openproject_update_work_package(
    work_package_id=task_id,
    status_id=79,  # In testing
    description="Task complete. Tests passed. Ready for test team validation."
)

# Add comment
mcp_openproject_add_work_package_comment(
    work_package_id=task_id,
    comment="Implementation complete. Unit tests: Pass. Integration tests: Pass."
)
```

### Step 3: Handle Bugs

**When bug is created:**

1. **Review Bug** → Get bug details
2. **Fix Bug** → Update status to "In progress" (77)
3. **Complete Fix** → Update status to "In testing" (79)
4. **Add Comment** → Document fix
5. **Iterate** → If test fails, fix again

```python
# Fix bug
mcp_openproject_update_work_package(
    work_package_id=bug_id,
    status_id=77  # In progress
)

# ... fix bug ...

# Mark bug ready for test
mcp_openproject_update_work_package(
    work_package_id=bug_id,
    status_id=79,  # In testing
    description="Bug fixed. Ready for test team validation."
)
```

### Step 4: Mark Story Ready for Test

**When all tasks are closed:**

```python
# Verify all tasks closed
children = mcp_openproject_get_work_package_children(parent_id=story_id)
tasks = [c for c in children["children"] if c["type"] == "Task"]
all_tasks_closed = all(task["status"] == "Closed" for task in tasks)

if all_tasks_closed:
    # Mark story ready for test
    mcp_openproject_update_work_package(
        work_package_id=story_id,
        status_id=79  # In testing
    )
```

## Checklist

**Before starting implementation:**
- [ ] Verify all tasks exist in OpenProject
- [ ] Verify all tasks are linked to story
- [ ] Review task descriptions and acceptance criteria

**During implementation:**
- [ ] Update task status as work progresses
- [ ] Add comments to tasks documenting progress
- [ ] Update story file to mark tasks complete
- [ ] Fix bugs assigned by test team
- [ ] Iterate on bug fixes until closed

**Before marking story ready for test:**
- [ ] All tasks are "Closed" (82)
- [ ] All bugs are "Closed" (82)
- [ ] Story marked "In testing" (79)
